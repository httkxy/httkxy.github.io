I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). I have been recommended for direct Ph.D. admission to the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

My research interests lie in computer vision, image editing, and image generation, with a particular focus on controllable generation and vision-language understanding.
